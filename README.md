# HuffmanDecoding
Java solution to HackerRank's Huffman Decoding challenge:

**Given a pointer to the root of a Huffman tree and a binary coded string, 
we need to print the decoded string.**

The solution is all of what's in the Decoding class. The rest is just boilerplate code 
from the HackerRank problem.

**Input:** input is specified as an actual string, which then gets encoded and our solution decodes it.
So essentially we're returning as our output, the same input we provided.
